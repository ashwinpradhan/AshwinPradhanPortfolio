                        <p>
                            Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin 
                            with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. 
                            But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price 
                            negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.
                            It is a Advanced Problem of Regression which requires advanced techniques of feature engineering, 
                            feature selection and extraction, modelling, model evaluation, and Statistics.
                        <p>
                            The goal of this project is to predict the sales price for each house.

                            The output of a predictive churn model is a measure of the immediate or future risk of a customer 
                            cancellation.

                            The data set contains details of a bank's customers and the target variable is a binary 
                            variable reflecting the fact whether the customer left the bank (closed his account) or he continues to be a customer.

                        <p>
                            The Company wants to automate the loan eligibility process (real time) based on customer detail 
                            provided while filling online application form. These details are Gender, Marital Status, 
                            Education, Number of Dependents, Income, Loan Amount, Credit History and others. 
                            To automate this process, they have given a problem to identify the customers segments, 
                            those are eligible for loan amount so that they can specifically target these customers.

                            From  the given information about the application the goal of this project is to predict whether 
                            theyâ€™ll able to pay the loan or not.

                        <h3>Credit Card Fraud Detection</h3>
                        <p>
                            It is important that credit card companies are able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions 
                            so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase.
                            The dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders.
                            This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. 
                            The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The goal of this project is to predict whether transactions made was fraud or real transaction.

                        <h3>URL Shortener</h3>
                        <p>
                            URL shortening is a technique on the World Wide Web in which a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) 
                            may be made substantially shorter and still direct to the required page. This is achieved by using a 
                            redirect which links to the web page that has a long URL.
                            For example, the URL <span> "https://example.com/assets/category_B/subcategory_C/Foo/" </span>
                            can be shortened to 
                            <span> "https://example.com/Foo" </span>, and the URL 
                            <span>"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL_shortening"</span> 
                            can be shortened to <span> "https://w.wiki/U".</span> 
                            Often the redirect domain name is shorter than the original one.
                        </p>
